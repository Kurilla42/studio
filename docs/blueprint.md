# **App Name**: ProFlow Plumbing

## Core Features:

- Rotating Tagline: Dynamically rotates through 'Trust,' 'Afford,' and 'Get Fast' in the hero section to emphasize key benefits, enhancing user engagement with automatically animated taglines. The 'Trust' portion of this tagline also functions as a tool for subtly instilling confidence in potential customers.
- Fixed Header: Implements a header that remains fixed at the top of the viewport, offering continuous access to navigation and contact information as users scroll. This ensures that key features are always visible and easy to use.
- Contact Form Submission: Allows users to submit inquiries through a contact form in the footer and contact modal, streamlining the process for those seeking more info or quotes. If database persistance is available, capture contact requests and log a success state after completing each request.
- Emergency Banner: Full-width banner highlighting emergency plumbing services with 24/7 availability, featuring an animated shimmer to draw attention and quickly provide an intuitive experience
- Live Chat Widget: AI-driven chat widget facilitating real-time customer interaction. Deploys AI to recommend specific actions/answers that improve the UX experience for new clients visiting for the first time
- Social Proof Notifications: Provides popup notifications to website visitors such as, recent installations or emergency fixes and testimonials to encourage new customers. This is done through real or mocked customer engagement analytics
- Exit Intent Modal: Appears when the user tries to exit the website and offers valuable incentives (e.g., Free Consultation). Prevents abandonment while subtly boosting the plumbing service by helping convince customers to remain onsite.
